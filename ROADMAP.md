Perfect! Hereâ€™s a **task-based roadmap with milestones** for VerbyFlow MVP using **Kotlin + WebRTC + DIA + Whisper**, designed to be fed directly into Windsurf or used for sprint planning:

---

## ðŸ—‚ **VerbyFlow MVP Development Roadmap (Kotlin + WebRTC + DIA + Whisper)**

### **Milestone 0 â€” Setup & Environment**

**Goal:** Prepare dev environment for Kotlin Android app with AI and WebRTC support.
**Tasks:**

1. Install **Android Studio** and configure Kotlin project.
2. Integrate **Jetpack Compose** for UI.
3. Add **WebRTC library** (e.g., `org.webrtc:google-webrtc`) to dependencies.
4. Add **gRPC Kotlin plugin** and dependencies for metadata/control channels.
5. Integrate DI/architecture framework (e.g., Hilt or Koin).
6. Setup local testing environment (emulator, device, localhost Ktor server).

---

### **Milestone 1 â€” Voice Embedding / Onboarding**

**Goal:** Capture a userâ€™s voice to enable DIA TTS cloning.
**Tasks:**

1. Create **Voice Setup Screen** (5â€“10s recording).
2. Capture audio using `AudioRecord`.
3. Run **ECAPA-TDNN** locally to generate voice embedding.
4. Store embedding locally (encrypted) and optionally on Ktor server.
5. Test playback to verify embedding is correctly stored and reusable.

---

### **Milestone 2 â€” Call Setup & WebRTC**

**Goal:** Establish low-latency peer-to-peer call connections.
**Tasks:**

1. Implement **Call UI** with Start/End buttons.
2. Setup **WebRTC peer connections** between two devices.
3. Integrate **STUN/TURN** servers for NAT traversal.
4. Optional: Use **gRPC** for session signaling and metadata.
5. Test connection between emulator â†” emulator and emulator â†” device.

---

### **Milestone 3 â€” Audio Capture & Playback**

**Goal:** Enable real-time audio streaming through WebRTC.
**Tasks:**

1. Capture microphone input (`AudioRecord`) continuously.
2. Encode and stream via WebRTC peer channel.
3. Receive peer audio and play via `AudioTrack`.
4. Test for **latency**, clipping, or dropouts.

---

### **Milestone 4 â€” Whisper STT Integration**

**Goal:** Transcribe audio in real time for translation.
**Tasks:**

1. Integrate **Whisper Small** for streaming transcription (on-device or via lightweight server).
2. Stream captured audio to Whisper model.
3. Display real-time captions in the UI.
4. Test accuracy, latency, and handling of accented speech.

---

### **Milestone 5 â€” Translation**

**Goal:** Translate transcribed text into target language.
**Tasks:**

1. Use Whisper translation mode OR integrate local translation model (e.g., MarianMT).
2. Output translated text for TTS.
3. Ensure translation does not block audio streaming.
4. Test with multiple languages, including Igbo/Yoruba.

---

### **Milestone 6 â€” DIA TTS Integration**

**Goal:** Generate synthesized speech in the userâ€™s voice.
**Tasks:**

1. Send translated text + stored embedding to **DIA TTS**.
2. Receive audio chunks and stream them to peer device.
3. Play synthesized speech via `AudioTrack` in near real time.
4. Test audio quality, latency, and embedding consistency.

---

### **Milestone 7 â€” Speaker Verification (Optional)**

**Goal:** Detect if speaker changes during a call.
**Tasks:**

1. Re-embed audio periodically using ECAPA-TDNN.
2. Compare to stored embedding for identity verification.
3. If mismatch, prompt user for new profile or fallback to generic TTS.

---

### **Milestone 8 â€” MVP Polish & Testing**

**Goal:** Finalize MVP for beta testing.
**Tasks:**

1. Optimize **latency**: capture â†’ STT â†’ translation â†’ TTS â†’ playback.
2. Handle **network issues**: jitter, packet loss, reconnections.
3. Implement **logging** for call duration, latency, errors.
4. Test **two devices** on LAN or emulator.
5. Prepare **APK build** for internal testers.

---

### **Milestone 9 â€” Optional Backend**

**Goal:** Deploy **Ktor server** for coordination, storage, or fallback.
**Tasks:**

1. Implement endpoints for user registration, embedding storage, and signaling.
2. Deploy on **Render / Fly.io / Railway**.
3. Ensure secure communication and minimal latency.
4. Integrate with Kotlin app for optional fallback features.

### **Sprint Organization (Example)**

| Sprint | Focus                                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Environment setup, onboarding + voice embedding    |
| 2      | WebRTC call setup + audio capture/playback         |
| 3      | Whisper STT + live captions                        |
| 4      | Translation + DIA TTS streaming                    |
| 5      | Speaker verification + pipeline optimization       |
| 6      | Testing, bug fixes, MVP build, backend integration |

This roadmap keeps everything **Kotlin-native**, uses **WebRTC for real-time voice**, and integrates **Whisper + DIA + ECAPA-TDNN** seamlessly.

I can also **draw a visual diagram showing the full WebRTC + Whisper + DIA pipeline with embeddings** if you want something you can include directly in Windsurf for reference.

Do you want me to do that next?
